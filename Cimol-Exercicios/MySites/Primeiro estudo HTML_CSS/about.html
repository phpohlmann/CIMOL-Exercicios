            <h3><pre>
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Ooh, woah 
Won't you come see about me? 
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby 
Tell me your troubles and doubts 
Giving everything inside and out and 
Love's strange, so real in the dark 
Think of the tender things that we were working on 
Slow change may pull us apart 
When the light gets into your heart, baby 
Don't you, forget about me 
Don't, don't, don't, don't 
Don't you, forget about me 
Will you stand above me? 
Look my way, never love me 
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling 
Down, down, down 
Will you recognize me? 
Call my name or walk on by 
Rain keeps falling, rain keeps falling 
Down, down, down, down 
Hey, hey, hey, hey 
Ooh, woah 
Don't you try and pretend 
It's my feeling we'll win in the end 
I won't harm you or touch your defenses 
Vanity and security, ah 
Don't you forget about me 
I'll be alone, dancing, you know it, baby 
Going to take you apart 
I'll put us back together at heart, baby 
Don't you, forget about me 
Don't, don't, don't, don't 
Don't you, forget about me 
As you walk on by 
Will you call my name? 
As you walk on by 
Will you call my name? 
When you walk away 
Or will you walk away? 
Will you walk on by? 
Come on, call my name 
Will you call my name? 
I say 
La, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la 
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la 
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la 
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
When you walk on by 
And you call my name 
When you walk on by
